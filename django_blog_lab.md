# Blog Lab

Create a Django project with a blog application.

Project requirements:
* Blog Model - What are the attributes that we need to save?
* ForeignKey to User - [Using the Django authentication system](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/auth/default/)
* Connect the blog model to the admin with admin.py - [The Django admin site](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/contrib/admin/)
* Url, View, Template - Create your urls, views and template that shows all blog entries.
* Set Up Static - [Managing static files (e.g. images, JavaScript, CSS)](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/howto/static-files/)

# Advanced
* Create a separate view and template so we can see each blog post as a full page.
* Allow the author to upload an image for the blog post.

# Super Advanced
* Make the image a full background of a div that takes up the top half of the screen with the blog post title overlaid.
* Create a page that is restricted to logged in users with a form that allows us to create a new blog post.
